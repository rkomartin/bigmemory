# These first notes document changes to the BOOST includes required
# for the Bigmemory Project.

1. Removed boost/interprocess/containers/detail since it was empty.
2. os_file_functions.hpp: Changed line 125 from

  if(size > filesize){

  to 

  if(size > static_cast<std::size_t>(filesize)){

  to get rid of the compiler warning.

3. seed_rng.hpp: Changed line 150 from

  std::fread( buffer, 1, 20, random_ );
 
  to 

  size_t temp = std::fread( buffer, 1, 20, random_ );

# These second notes document a change required to get Sun Studio 12.1
# working with C++.

# See http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5393796,
# the comment by liboqun on Dec 10, 2009.  We followed the
# instructions, replacing the 12.1 version of cdefs.h with
# the recommended version from Sun Studio 12, resolving the
# problem (errors relating to stdio.h).
